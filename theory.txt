* npm facilitate for packages installation

* for setup a node js project at first we have to run command 
npm(node package manager) init -y

* commands of npm
-->npm init -y //this command will create a pakage.json file which contains all the information of our project,installed modules as dependencies etc.

* Now, we have to create server in node js using builtin HTTP module 
localhost:3000
localhost-->host name
3000-->port 
/-->home route or end point

* node_modules
-->npm i / npm install

* Express: frame work node js
-->npm install express --save //we need not to write --save
-->npm uninstall express

* nodemon
-->npm i -g nodemon //-g for global
-->npm uninstall nodemon
-->Nodemon is a lifesaver for Node.js developers! It's a command-line tool that streamlines the development process. Here's how it works:

Automatic Restart: Nodemon watches your project directory for file changes.
Whenever you make a change to a JavaScript file in your project, nodemon automatically restarts your Node.js application. 
This eliminates the manual step of stopping and restarting your application every time you make a code change.

Efficiency Booster: By automatically restarting your application, nodemon saves you tons of time during development.
You can focus on writing code, testing changes quickly, and iterating rapidly.

Seamless Workflow: Nodemon integrates smoothly into your development workflow. 
Just replace the usual node command with nodemon when starting your Node.js application. Nodemon takes care of the rest.

* Node.js is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which allows it to handle a large number of simultaneous connections efficiently.
This architecture is primarily built around its single-threaded event loop and additional worker threads managed by the libuv library. 

* Dev dependencies


* package-lock.json
